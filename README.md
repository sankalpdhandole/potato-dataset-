Potato disease classification refers to the categorization or grouping of various diseases that affect potato plants. This classification typically involves identifying and distinguishing between different types of diseases such as early blight, late blight, bacterial wilt, blackleg, and many others. Classification can be based on various factors including the symptoms exhibited by the plants, the pathogens responsible for the diseases, and the specific conditions that promote their development. Effective classification helps in understanding the epidemiology of potato diseases, implementing appropriate control measures, and developing strategies for disease management in potato cultivation.
