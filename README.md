Smart Crop Health Monitoring: A Deep Learning Approach for Potato Disease Detection
Project Overview
The agricultural sector faces significant challenges due to diseases affecting potato plants, leading to economic losses and crop wastage. Traditional methods of disease identification are laborious and time-consuming, hindering timely intervention. This project presents "Smart Crop Health Monitoring: A Deep Learning Approach for Potato Disease Detection," utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop robust models for automated classification of potato diseases based on input images. Specifically, we implement both a custom CNN model and the VGG-16 model, tailored to extract and classify features indicative of potato diseases.

Our approach includes preprocessing raw potato plant images, training the models, and optimizing them using techniques like quantization and pruning to improve efficiency and reduce model size. Additionally, a user-friendly web application enables farmers to capture and analyze images of potato plants in real-time, providing timely insights into crop health status. By leveraging advanced technologies and deep learning techniques, this project aims to mitigate economic losses, reduce crop wastage, and enhance overall crop yield in the agricultural domain.

Empower farmers with user-friendly interfaces for real-time image analysis, enabling prompt assessment of crop health status and informed decision-making.
Mitigate economic losses, reduce crop wastage, and improve overall crop yield through timely disease detection and management.
Dataset
The Plant Village dataset sourced from Kaggle comprises images of potato plant leaves categorized into three classes: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for disease detection and classification tasks.

Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising images of potato plants affected by various diseases, as well as healthy specimens.
Data Annotation: Annotate the dataset to label each image with the corresponding disease type or healthy status.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by resizing images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to increase diversity and robustness.
Model Development
Custom CNN Model:

Design and experiment with different architectures to optimize performance.
Train the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.
Validate and evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
VGG-16 Model:

Utilize the pre-trained VGG-16 model for transfer learning.
Fine-tune the model on the potato disease dataset to adapt it to the classification task.
Model Optimization

Results
Custom CNN Model: Achieved an accuracy of 98.21% on the testing dataset.
VGG-16 Model: Achieved an accuracy of 99.34% on the testing dataset.
These results demonstrate the high effectiveness of both models in accurately detecting and classifying potato diseases, with the VGG-16 model slightly outperforming the custom CNN model.

Conclusion
The project has successfully developed and evaluated deep learning models for potato disease detection, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. These models hold significant promise in assisting farmers with timely and accurate assessments of crop health, thereby facilitating proactive measures to mitigate economic losses and improve overall agricultural productivity.
